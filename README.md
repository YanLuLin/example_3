A relaxation iteration method with three parameters for solving absolute value equation. 

Example 3. Consider the AVE with block tridiagonal coefficient matrix A=M_hat+uI,where M_hat=tridiag(−1.5I,S,−0.5I) with S=tridiag(−1.5,4,−0.5),n=m^2,x_star= (-1,1,-1,1,••• ,-1,1)^T is the exact solution of AVE.
